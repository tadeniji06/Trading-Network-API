# Simulated Social Trading API

Welcome to the **Simulated Social Trading Network API**, where fake money meets real dopamine hits. This is the backend for a web app that lets users flex their trading skills without the risk of actually going broke. Built with **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**, because why not?

## 🚀 Features
- **Google Authentication** – Because nobody likes typing passwords.
- **Virtual $100K Portfolio** – Get rich (virtually) or cry trying.
- **Manual & Automated Trades** – Enter trade amounts, or set limit/stop orders like a pro.
- **Real-Time Market Data** – Powered by **CoinGecko API** (because free > expensive).
- **Dashboard Stats** – Win/loss percentages, trading history, and ego-boosting charts.
- **Friends & Leaderboards** – Compete, compare, and question your life choices.
- **Trade Sharing** – Post your Ls, flex your Ws, and pretend you're a hedge fund manager.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth
- **Market Data:** CoinGecko API
- **Hosting:** TBD (probably something free...)

## 📡 API Endpoints (WIP)
- **`POST /auth/google`** – Authenticate users via Google.
- **`GET /dashboard`** – Fetch user stats and trading data.
- **`POST /trade`** – Simulate a buy/sell order.
- **`GET /leaderboard`** – See who’s cooking (or who’s getting cooked).
- **More to come...**

## ⚠️ Disclaimers
- This is **not** a real trading platform. You can’t cash out, so don’t even try.
- If you lose all your virtual money, just reset your account like nothing happened.
- If something breaks, just refresh. That’s the tech industry’s golden rule anyway.
